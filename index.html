                            <h2>Live Rapid MiniTWOW hosting tool</h2>

                            <p class="normal">This tool was created and designed by <em>wooningc</em>, 2019</p>
                            <p class="normal">This runs a small-scale game based on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S64R-_LVHuY" target="_blank">Ten Words of Wisdom</a>” by <em>carykh</em></p>
                            <p class="normal">Rapid MiniTWOWs were popularized by <em>alexlion0511</em> (I think) and <em>DemiPixel</em></p>

                            <br />

                            <p class="normal">The purpose of this tool is to create visuals intended for a livestreamed season of a Rapid MiniTWOW.</p>
                            <p class="normal">Ten Words of Wisdom, abbreviated as TWOW, is a game that tests contestants’ ability to write a clever ten-word response given a prompt. Viewers vote on these responses based on their quality and cleverness, assigning to each a relative score. These scores are averaged, and the lowest-scoring contestants are eliminated from the game, which then progresses to the next round with a new prompt.</p>
                            <p class="normal">A Rapid MiniTWOW functions much more quickly and at a much smaller scale than a larger game of TWOW. Responding and voting periods are shortened from the original three days to about three minutes. One season usually consists of less than six rounds.</p>
                            <p class="normal">Individually, this tool does not have the ability to record or supply data to a livestream. Instead, move the display to a separate window to maximize the output resolution and use software such as <a href="https://obsproject.com/download" target="_blank">Open Broadcaster Software</a> to record it. (Screen recorders may have to do some troubleshooting [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yaQfjam0xo">Google Chrome</a>] to target a browser)</p>
                            <p class="normal">Games are not saved across sessions. Navigating away from the page will cause the current game’s data to be lost.</p>
